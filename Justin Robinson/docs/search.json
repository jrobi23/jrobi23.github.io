This fellowship is a combined 2-year outcomes-based research and masters degree academic immersive experience. Prior to joining Cleveland Clinic, he completed 2 of 6 years of cardiothoracic surgery training at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, MD.\nBefore embarking on the path to become a physician, he worked as a paramedic for 4 years, 2 of which as a SWAT paramedic. He then went on to obtain my Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry from Wayne State University in 2017. After obtaining his bachelors degree, he applied to and was accepted to Michigan State University College of Human Medicine for medical school and graduated in 2021."

    "text": "Research\n\nCurrent Project\nExamine a cohort of patients with complete atrioventricular septal defects (CAVSD). This will build upon previously published data that have examined and defined the echocardiographic features of unbalanced CAVSD. The enrollment of this cohort is ongoing, but data collected from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2022 will be analyzed. This cohort comprises infants diagnosed with CAVSD &lt;3mo of age, with AV and VA concordance. Baseline demographics, assessment of pre-operative and follow-up echocardiographic measurements previously used to define unbalanced CAVSD and additional echocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements will be analyzed. An echo corelab will review all echo images. A dedicated group of data scientists will combine echo measurements and patient characteristics to improve and better define the phenotype of non-severe forms of unbalanced CAVSD. This project will use advanced machine learning techniques to find specific variables/characteristics that clearly separate groups of patients. After delineation of groups, our focus will be on examining the type of operation performed and associated outcomes. These data will allow us to predict the optimal surgical strategy for patients previously known to have poor outcomes. For patients who are classified as being extremely left or right-dominant, the surgical approach is single-ventricle palliation. However, the still perplexing question is, what surgical pathway should patients in the non-extreme, “gray” area undergo? This question desperately needs to be answered to improve survival and outcomes in this population. Therefore, a surgical strategy for one patient who exhibits non-severe unbalanced CAVSD may not benefit a patient in a similar case. Therefore, taking a closer look into these borderline patients is paramount to “personalize” surgical strategies. After thoroughly investigating this patient cohort and examining multiple areas, we can better define patients with unusual anatomic features or those on the cusp of extremely right or left dominant, understand outcomes associated with various repair strategies, and devise a reproducible surgical pathway tool to assist clinicians.\n\n\nPublications\nRobinson J, Karamlou T.
